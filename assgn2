'''2.Define a class Person and its two child classes: Male and Female. All classes have a method "get_gender" which can print "Male" for Male class and " Female" for Female Class.
Bonus: Make class Person an abstract class and make get_gender an abstract method in the same class. The two child classes must inherit and implement get_gender'''
